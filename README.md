# Next.js router.push() Inconsistency Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where `router.push()` in Next.js behaves unexpectedly. The issue is primarily observed in complex routing situations, particularly within nested components or with dynamic routes.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior, while `bugSolution.js` offers a potential workaround.

## Problem Description

The `router.push()` method, used for client-side navigation, fails to transition correctly under certain conditions.  These conditions may include, but aren't limited to:

* **Deeply nested routing:**  Problems emerge when navigating from components many levels deep within the component tree.
* **Dynamic route segments:**  Inconsistencies might occur when working with routes containing dynamic parameters.
* **Transitions involving complex state changes:**  Transitions alongside updates to a large amount of application state.

## Solution

The proposed solution in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a work-around.  However, it is important to analyze the root cause in your specific application context.  Possible causes include:

* **Incorrect usage of `router.push()`:** Ensure the path is correct, and that you haven't mistakenly used other navigation methods that might interfere.
* **Conflicting state management:** If you're using a state management library, ensure it doesn't interfere with the router's operation.
* **Asynchronous operations:**  Verify that `router.push` is called after any relevant asynchronous actions are complete.
* **Navigation Guard Issues:** Consider using Next.js's `beforePopState` and `onPopState` navigation guards.  Misconfigurations in these can lead to unexpected routing behaviors.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Interact with the application to reproduce the behavior described above.  Note that you might need to adjust the application's navigation structure to trigger the bug.
